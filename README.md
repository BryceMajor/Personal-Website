My project was a simple webpage with the design of describing myself.
I split it into four different HTML pages and also have two other files attached for my CSS and JS.
The four HTML pages are inedx.html for the main home page, about.html for the about page,
portfolio.html for the portfolio page, and contact.html for the contact section.
these six simple files made my small first website and I hope you enjoy!
